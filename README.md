##  What’s Inside

This repository contains sample code and configurations for integrating Spring AI into a Spring Boot application:

-  Demonstrations of prompt engineering and structured responses  
-  Usage of the `ChatClient` to interface with language models  
-  Examples of model portability—switching between providers like OpenAI, Ollama, or Mistral with minimal code changes :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
